    <h2>The answer is blowing in the wind</h2>
    <p>With the autumn wind, the seed of the plantation spreads through the air and covers the ground as far as the wind takes it. 
        
        We call ourselves the leafblowers, because we decided to help the wind spread life on our planet. 
        
        Because of deforestation, we have acknowledged that there is not enough seeds to be carried away in the autumn wind. 
        
        Deforestation is a critical issue that affects our world in many ways. Trees and forests are essential for the health and stability of our planet. 
        They play an important role in mitigating climate change, regulating the water cycle, maintaining biodiversity and providing resources for people and wildlife.
        
        Yet despite their importance, forests are being destroyed at an alarming rate. Deforestation contributes significantly to the increase in greenhouse gases, which exacerbates global warming, accelerates climate change and damages ecosystems worldwide. 
        The destruction of forests also disrupts the water cycle, leading to soil erosion, desertification and the loss of habitats for many species.</p>
